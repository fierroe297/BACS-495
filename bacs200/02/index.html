        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A smile no matter what - A smile gives others hope</li>
        <li>Motivate others - A person with a lifestyle who is their to help others</li>
        <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
        <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
        <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Over the last 100 years no man exemplifies these values for me more than
        Martin Luther King. He called people to be accountable for the racial
        prejudices that we all carry. He demonstrated that violence is not the
        best way to create lasting change. And throughout his life he sacrificed
        everything to make the world better.
